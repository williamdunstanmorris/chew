Why Chew?
---------
If you're continually chewin' the cud, and always pointlessly tweaking your devops configurations and scripts, that's not good. Chew can help you abstract some of these scripts back into a developer-esque workflow. This can also help you manage multiple scripts for multiple repos and code bases simultaneously.

Overview
--------
Chew is currently python package for managing scripts, playbooks and files. It's an object-orientated for helping you both generate and maintain your scripts at a higher level through instances.

.. note::

   An assumed knowledge of programming and devops tools are required for using this - However! A lot of this code is quite simple, and creating your own scripts this way is a great way in understanding how some of these technologies work and differ from each another. Some of the original documentation is just insanely long. And boring.
